Express_Notes
	Express is a fast unopinionated minimalist web framework for node.

Routing in Express
	Core component of the framework

Jade Template Engine
	use to render HTML in the front end

Express Static Server
	how express loads images, styles, scripts, and other static files to the browser

Express.js is a web framework for Node.js

Express has a complete API reference

To install Express
	npm install express --save

Turn folder into a node project
	run "npm init"

To use node modules in a file they need to be "required" using the "require" method

Route: (sometimes called an endpoint)
	just a url

Client: (possible web browser)
	device used to visit the website

When changes are made to the site, dont forget to restart the server
	command c

To run server
	node src/app
	from command line

To run debugger
	node-debug src/app.js

*Run node inspector first
	node-inspector
		in another terminal you will run nodemon
			nodemon --debug src/app.js
				by adding -brk this will allow the terminal to stop on the debug brk that is in your code
					nodemon --debug-brk src/app.js

	***to kill a (PID) Process ID
		In the command line do the following:
			netstat -a -n -o | findstr :(ENTER YOUR PORT NUMBER)
				taskkill /pid (ENTER THE PID)
					ex. taskkill /pid 5728
					if you need to force kill it use the following:
					ex. taskkill /F /pid 5728

Template Rendering
	also known as views (templates)
	the view is sent to the client as html 
	templates have there own syntax and language
	they live on the server and act as an html skeleton
	template provides as a basic structure for a webpage

Popular Templating Languages for 
	Templates are static (their content changes)
	they are stored on the server
	You can use any template lang for express
		Handlebars
		EJS (Embedded JS)
		JADE

New blocks that are not defined will auto into <div>

To render a template in the index route:
	---> this should alread be there
	app.get('/', function(req, res){
  		res.render('index')
	});

	you will add this:
	app.get('/blog/:PageYouAreRending?', function(req, res){
  		res.render('CallingThePageToRenderFromResponse');
	});

Jade uses the 'block' keyword to break chunks of content up for use across different files, or to be changed dynamically.

The static server should be used to serve the following types of files, EXCEPT: .JADE

How to convert an object to an array in the command line
	start express service with debug
	launcch node inspector
	add break point at app.js file
	In command line type "posts"
	use object.keys method to generate an array of keys from the posts object
		Object.keys(posts)
	arrays have a map method and receives a callback and the param is the key of the current postion in the array
		Object.keys(posts).map(function(value){return posts[value]})
	this is give you an array of each object

Jade can iterate through **array objects** or **plain objects**.

The following method:
	'Object.keys(foobar)' 
	will return an array of keys for an object called `foobar`.

Template engines allow you to add logic directly into the template

How data is routed from the server can not be accomplished using logic in Jade Templates

Install express-generator
	npm install express-generator -g
		Use the express command with the param of the name of your app
			express TESTAPP
				once done follow the instruction
				after you do the last thing 'npm install' you want to fire up the server
					npm start
						npm start will throw all the strang commmands to start your application into the package.json file
